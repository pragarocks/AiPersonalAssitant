"""Parlor — on-device, real-time multimodal AI (voice + vision).

LLM inference runs on llama.cpp (llama-server, spawned as a subprocess —
see llama.py). This server owns the conversation history and re-sends it
every request; llama-server's prefix cache makes that cheap, and it also
enables two speculative tricks (see pipeline.py): the camera frame and the
user's speech (in ~3s chunks) are pushed through cache-priming requests
WHILE the user is still talking, so the final request only pays for the
tail of the utterance.
