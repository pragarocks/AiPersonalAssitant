"""Session modes: what kind of interaction the session is in decides how
turns are gated and prompted. The default is open conversation; 'translate'
turns Parlor into a consecutive interpreter — every utterance rendered in
English on a short silence window, no conversational replies; 'listen'
turns it into a silent scribe — every utterance transcribed, nothing
spoken back until the user asks for a reply again.

A mode is data, not behavior: server.py consults these flags instead of
hardcoding, so a future mode (an interpreter pair, camera narration) is a
new entry here plus whatever new trigger it needs, not a rewrite of the
turn loop. Switching is decided by the action head (actions.py) judging
each utterance, with a UI escape hatch (the client's mode chip sends
set_mode directly).
